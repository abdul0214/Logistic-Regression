# Logistic-Regression
K class Logistic Regression Classification based on K binary logistic classifiers
Abstract—The aim of this repo is to demonstrate the use of
K-Binary Logistic Classifiers for K class classification as a valid
and efficient technique compared to the relatively complex and
computationally cumbersome Multiclass Logistic Regression
techniques for K class classification such as the one implemented
by MATLAB as mnrfit() in Statistics and Machine Learning
Toolbox™. For testing purposes we used a dataset from UCI [1]
data sets repository. The data set is described in detail in the
report. Detailed formulation of the classification based on KBinary Logistic Classifiers is provided. The developed method
can be downloaded as a MATLAB toolbox
